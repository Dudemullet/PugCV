  .thin-font I'm a computer science major and have been doing full stack web development for over 15 years. I was also the first engineer for Konfio, Mexico's 3rd unicorn. While at this company I was able to grow from being a front-end engineer to a full blown solutions architect for which I got the certification from AWS's ceritifications program.
