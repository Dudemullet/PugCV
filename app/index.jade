        I have recently gotten very into Node. I had been using it mostly as a build tool for the last 3 years, but I now use it as my main development platform from where I try to use as most tools from it as I can. I also like contributing back to the dependencies in my projects and giving presentations in my local javascript meetups. I also like to run 5~10 Kilometers every day and I'm currently training to run a marathon.
